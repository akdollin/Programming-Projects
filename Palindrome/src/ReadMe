To Run: This program runs off of the file palindrome.txt. Simply run the program.

This program has three classes.

Stack Class: This is a generic stack class. It uses an array to save the data, with a pointer at the bottom.
It has a push method that puts the data type into the array and a pop method that returns the top of the stack. 
The isEmpty and isFull methods are there to catch exceptions. 

PalindromeTester Class: This is the main class. It is very simple. 
It uses a try catch to catch bad file input and creates an instance of the Palindrome class and passes the file into the Palindrome class.

Palindrome Class: This class uses a scanner to read each line of the file. 
It then calls the lineCheck() with the line.
The lineCheck() takes in the String and deletes all special characters, white spaces and changes all capitals to lower case. 
The palindromeChecker() puts half the finalLine into the stack. If the line is an odd palindrome ex: 
Racecar, the character one after the remaining letters and the character that is popped are compared. 
The loop continues throughout the line. For an even palindrome ex: Hannah, the remaining characters and the 
popped characters are compared. 
If the line is a palindrome, it prints the original line and then continues with the next line.
