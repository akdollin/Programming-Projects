Game class: The game class has four set of variable to begin with. 
1- for the scanner input which is the user guess.

2-the new scanner for repeating the game or not
	This could be done without a separate scanner, 
	but it makes it more clear if i make a new one.
	
3- the variables used to determine when you win, and how many guesses it took you

4- Your best worst and average scores. The bestTry begins at a very high number, 
because it requires it to begin the loop without throwing off the first round. 
After the first round, bestTry is redefined and is no longer a ridiculous number. 

The constructor method initializes the scanner input and sets up the rounds up to begin the counter. 

The play method has three nested while loops. 
The innermost one is used to make sure the user puts in 4 digits. 
The middle loop is to determine when the game is over, or when their are 4 bulls. 
The outermost loop is to keep track of when to stop playing and when to increment the counter of rounds. 

There is then a series of if statements regarding the best worst and average cases.

Oracle Class:
The oracle class is made up of 4 methods. 

1) The constructor simply initializes the instance variable generated number which is found by the randomizer. 
2)The randomizer method randomly takes 4 unique digits and concatenates them into a string. 
3) The bulls method checks for whether specific digits are the same,
and whether they are the same in the same position within the string. 
This is why charAt is used. 
4)The cows method is similar, however, when there is a bull, 
technically it would increment the cows as well. 
So the if statement is used to show that if the number is similar but not in the right spot, 
it have no change upon the cows counter; while it is actually adding one and then subtracting one.
